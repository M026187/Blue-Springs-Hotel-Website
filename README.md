# Blue-Springs-Hotel-Website

## Case Study
You have been working for a web design company called Media Magic Inc for 2 years as a junior web developer. You have had a significant amount of experience working as a member of a development team. You are now ready to take on the primary responsibility for a new web design project under the supervision of your superior at Media Magic. 
You have been assigned to work on a web project for Blue Springs Hotel opening in Cossack, Western Australia (Bajinhurrba). 

They have need of a web site with the following requirements.   

### Pages to include: 

* Banner page to introduce the hotel (index.htm) 
* A page for the Acknowledgement of Country for the Ngarluma people on whose lands the hotel rests. Include a link to the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation(https://www.ngarluma.com.au/). See https://www.indigenous.gov.au/contact-us/welcome_acknowledgement-country for examples. 
* A staff page that lists the staff members with a name, title, and photo. On clicking on each photo, a popup appears with the name, title, and photo along with a short bio of the staff member and what they can help clients with. 
* A page with a short description of the town of Cossack itself with a map, and a link to the Wikipedia article about the town. 
* A page with links to various sites of interest within 150km of the town.  Include embedded Google maps locating each of the sites. 
* A page outlining activities for boating, fishing, swimming, indigenous awareness, and dining (include the hotel restaurant). 
* They would also like to have an online guest book created which will allow guests to enter a review of the hotel based on their stay. Your part of this is to create and layout the form. The backend form functionality will be implemented by a future developer. 
* Develop JavaScript which verifies that the user has entered information into every field and facilitate data entry 

Your lecturer will act as your supervisor in each case. 
Your lecturer will act as your client contact. 
You may collaborate with other students to research the required information. 
You may use search engines and ChatGPT to generate content for the website (include cite attribute references to tools used) but coding layout must be your own work. 
You need to ensure that you follow professional work standards and job role requirements in the performance of the project.
