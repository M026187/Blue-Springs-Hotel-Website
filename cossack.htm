                    <h2>COSSACK</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossack,_Western_Australia" target="_blank">Cossack Wikipedia Page</a></p>
                    <p>
                        Once the North West's first pastoral, gold rush and pearling port, today Cossack is a living
                        ghost town inviting you into 19th-century life with its fine National Trust-listed bluestone
                        architecture. It's also your gateway to the iconic Jarman Island Lighthouse and some of the
                        region's top fishing spots.</p>
                    <p>
                        Just a 20-minute drive north of Roebourne, 45 minutes east of Karratha, and two and a half hours
                        west of Port Hedland, Cossack can be reached within a few hours from Perth on a direct flight to
                        Karratha. You can also make the journey part of the adventure by following the 2,480 kilometre
                        Warlu Way. Revealing the mysteries of Indigenous legends, this interpretive trail leads you
                        through the iconic landscapes of Western Australia's Gascoyne, Pilbara and Kimberley regions.

                    <p>
                        Hit the Cossack Heritage Trail and take a journey back to Cossack's heyday, when it played host
                        to thousands of people seeking their fortunes in the Pilbara's growing pearling and gold mining
                        industries. Passing old ruins and eight proudly restored original buildings, you'll discover
                        Cossack's rapid rise and fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the migration of the pearling industry to Broome, the end of the gold rush and the opening
                        of Point Samson jetty, the town was dissolved in 1910 and abandoned by 1950. You'll therefore
                        find the vibe is very serene as you stroll down to beautiful Settlers Beach and lookout, explore
                        the mangroves, cruise across to historic Jarman Island, or cast a line in to chase mackerel,
                        salmon, bream, mangrove jack and barramundi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In July, you'll witness a very different scene as the town buzzes with the creative energy of
                        the annual Cossack Art Award. Recognised as the most isolated acquisitive art exhibition in the
                        world, and the richest award of its kind in Australia, it has featured the fine works of Ken
                        Done, Pro Hart, Robert Juniper, Jack Absalom, John Borrack, Wim Boissevain, Bevan
                        Pooraar-Hayward and Clifton Mack, to name a few.

                    <p>
                        To complete your Cossack experience, stay a night or three at Cossack's restored Police Barracks
                        which offers budget accommodation from early March to late December.
